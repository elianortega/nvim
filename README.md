# Nvim setup with support for Flutter/Dart (and DCM)
Prerequisite: install [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep).

## This setup has my personal keybinds.
**Feel free to switch, tweak or remove as you see fit!**

### Important to be aware of

1. The file that neovim loads first is `init.lua`, this loads `lua/elianortega/*`
2. For plugins we are using Lazy so you can either create an entry in `lua/plugins.lua` or add a file in `lua/plugins/{}`

### Thanks to
For some reason after using nvim insidev VS Code for a couple months I've decided to completely move to nvim and these repos and videos were extremelly useful.
